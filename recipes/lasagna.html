    <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium<br>heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato<br> paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon<br> salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1<br> 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in<br> boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In<br> a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons<br> parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <br>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch<br> baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2<br> of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.<br> Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup<br> Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and<br> Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with<br> cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an<br> additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
